1. open the zip file and you can see some files, including this readMe file, a screen shots and program file.

2. import the program in eclipse and add some necessary library into it, such as mysql and lucene. Then run separately two test file for two parts. You will be needed to type in some information as parameters. 

3. For first part, I use to two attributes to form index. The first is title name added with authorsâ€™ names, and the second is title name. As we want to search in title and author, and we want to return title name. 

For second part, as I first set one limit of the year attribute, I only search in the title. So I set one index and set two attributes for this index. They are both title name. As I want to search in the title name and return the title name.
